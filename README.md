Hi there!

this is my first web project.
I used just vanilla JS, CSS & HTML.

Time: 18 hours (learning new thing for html css and coding js)

updating: after I started React, I came back to this project to make some new features and improve the functionalities.

this coud be a good idea for a dictionary Wordpad like a leitner box or something like that.


anyway thank you to visiting my project. have a good time.
