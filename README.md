Hi there!

this is my first web project.
I used just vanilla JS, CSS & HTML.

Time: 18 hours (learning new thing for html css and coding js)

js lines  : 256
html lines: 92
css lines : 237

this coud be a good idea for a dictionary Wordpad like a leitner box or something like that.

this is not a responsive website so you have to use it just on the Desktop browser. ( you can add this feature if you like!)

anyway thank you to visiting my project. have a good time.
