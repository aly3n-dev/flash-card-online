Hi there!

this is my first web project.
I used just vanilla JS, CSS & HTML. (after updating I added Tailwindcss)

features: responsive - modern design - super light style files

Time: 18 hours (learning new thing for html css and coding js)

updating: 
-after I started React, I came back to this project to make some new features and improve the functionalities.
-edit button added to the notes.
-notes gathered into a single object, better way to handle.


anyway thank you to visiting my project. have a good time.
